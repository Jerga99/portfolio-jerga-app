      <p>My name is Filip Jerga and I am an experienced software engineer and freelance developer. </p>
      <p>
      I have a Master's degree in Artificial Intelligence and several years of experience working
      on a wide range of technologies and projects from C++ development for ultrasound devices to
        modern mobile and web applications in React and Angular.

      Throughout my career, I have acquired advanced technical knowledge and the ability to explain
      programming topics clearly and in detail to a broad audience. I invite you to take my course,
      where I have put a lot of effort to explain web and software engineering concepts in a detailed,
      hands-on and understandable way.
